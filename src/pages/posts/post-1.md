Welcome to the notes list, here there will be a daily log where you can see what Nate has been thinking about, or what hes been working on.

# What I've Accomplished

1. Nate went through a Full Stack Course, where he got to example many frameworks within the the tech sphere

2. He was able to use JavaScript/Typescript to mold applications to his needs, with the use of core logic, routes, middlewares, and many more implementations

3. He plans on using these skills to futher progress his coding experience and potentially create more expansive websites that have both functionality, and look great too

4. His goals are to stay consistent, and continue to try!
